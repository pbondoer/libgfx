# libgfx
A simple library to make miniLibX better :tada:

This is my small library for miniLibX. I started getting tired of reusing the
same functions in most of my projects so I built a more streamlined version that
compiles and works on both OS X and Linux.

## Features
* Multiple double-buffered windows
* Draw basic shapes (line, rectangle), outlined or filled

## Compiling
Run `make` to compile against the current OS as a target. Currently only Linux
and OS X (Darwin) are supported.

## License
